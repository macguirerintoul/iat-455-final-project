# iat-455-final-project

## About

This project is an adaptation of Peter Litwinowicz' image processing algorithm described in [_Processing Images and Video for An Impressionist Effect_](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/258734.258893). The app allows users to load an image file from their device and turn it into a painting via interactive parameter controls. The project was completed as part of IAT 455: Computational Media at [SIAT](https://www.sfu.ca/siat.html) SFU.
